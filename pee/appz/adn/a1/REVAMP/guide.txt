# adding a new option to the CLi 

I want to add a new option to the cli , 
- that will flatten the contract into one file, then it will be sent to the Gemini APi for analysis 
- After the gemini does the analysis the results should be in a markdown file with a heade that has the name of the project
- When this new option is chosen, there should be a terminal prompt to enter the API key and choose the model 
- This is the rough idea. Discuss and implement
- Always make a report of what you have done under the directory REVAMP with the title actions performed with the date and time appended to it , so i know what was done
