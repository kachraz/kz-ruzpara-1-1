# Actions Performed - Gemini AI Integration
**Date:** December 19, 2024 15:30 UTC

## Summary
Implemented a new CLI option for Gemini AI analysis that flattens contracts and sends them to Google's Gemini API for AI-powered security analysis.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dependencies
**File:** `aderyn/Cargo.toml`
- Added `rpassword = "7.3"` for secure API key input
- Added `chrono = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }` for timestamps

### 2. Created Gemini Analysis Module
**File:** `aderyn/src/gemini.rs` (NEW)
- `GeminiAnalyzer` struct for API communication
- `flatten_contracts()` function to collect and combine all Solidity files
- `prompt_for_api_credentials()` for interactive API key and model selection
- Comprehensive prompt engineering for security analysis
- Structured report generation with project metadata

**Key Features:**
- Supports multiple Gemini models (1.5-flash, 1.5-pro, 1.0-pro)
- Secure API key input (hidden from terminal)
- Automatic project name detection from package.json/foundry.toml
- Recursive Solidity file collection with smart directory filtering
- Structured analysis prompt for comprehensive security review
- Professional markdown report generation

### 3. Added CLI Subcommand
**File:** `aderyn/src/main.rs`
- Added `Gemini` subcommand to `MainSubcommand` enum
- Added module import for gemini functionality
- Implemented `handle_gemini_analysis()` async function

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
aderyn gemini                           # Uses default output file
aderyn gemini -o custom_report.md       # Custom output file
```

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Contract Flattening
- Recursively scans project directory for .sol files
- Skips common non-source directories (node_modules, .git, artifacts, cache)
- Combines all contracts into single flattened code with file headers
- Extracts project name from package.json, foundry.toml, or directory name

#### API Integration
- Interactive model selection with descriptions
- Secure API key input using rpassword
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Configurable generation parameters (temperature, tokens, etc.)

#### Analysis Prompt
Comprehensive prompt that requests:
- Critical Security Issues (fund loss potential)
- Medium Risk Issues (security concerns)
- Low Risk Issues (best practices)
- Gas Optimization Opportunities
- Code Quality Assessment
- Specific Recommendations

#### Report Format
- Professional markdown with project metadata
- Timestamp and model information
- Structured analysis sections
- Disclaimer about AI limitations
- Recommendations for comprehensive security practices

## User Experience Flow

1. **Command Execution:** User runs `aderyn gemini`
2. **Contract Discovery:** System finds and flattens all Solidity files
3. **Credential Input:** Interactive prompts for API key and model selection
4. **AI Analysis:** Code sent to Gemini API with structured security prompt
5. **Report Generation:** AI response formatted into professional markdown report
6. **File Output:** Report saved to specified file with success confirmation

## Technical Architecture

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing files, API errors, and invalid credentials
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Fallback to console output if file writing fails

### Security Considerations
- API key input is hidden from terminal
- No API key storage or logging
- User controls model selection and cost implications

### Performance
- Async implementation for API calls
- Efficient file system traversal
- Minimal memory footprint for large codebases

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various project structures:**
   - Foundry projects
   - Hardhat projects
   - Custom directory structures

2. **Test error scenarios:**
   - Invalid API keys
   - Network failures
   - Empty projects
   - Large codebases

3. **Validate output quality:**
   - Check report formatting
   - Verify analysis comprehensiveness
   - Test with known vulnerable contracts

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configuration File Support:** Allow API key and model preferences in config
2. **Batch Processing:** Support for multiple projects
3. **Integration with Existing Detectors:** Combine AI analysis with pattern-based detection
4. **Cost Estimation:** Pre-analysis cost calculation
5. **Local Model Support:** Integration with local LLM deployments

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Feature is fully implemented and ready for testing

## Implementation Summary

### Complete Implementation Details:

1. **CLI Integration**: Added `Gemini` subcommand to main CLI with output file option
2. **Async Handler**: Implemented `handle_gemini_analysis()` function with proper error handling
3. **Module Structure**: Created complete `gemini.rs` module with all necessary functionality
4. **Dependencies**: Added required crates for HTTP requests, password input, and timestamps

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Basic usage with default output
aderyn gemini

# Custom output file
aderyn gemini -o my_security_analysis.md

# Help for the command
aderyn gemini --help
```

### User Experience:
1. User runs `aderyn gemini` command
2. System scans and flattens all Solidity files in the project
3. Interactive prompts ask for:
   - Gemini API key (hidden input)
   - Model selection (1.5-flash, 1.5-pro, 1.0-pro)
4. Code is sent to Gemini API with comprehensive security analysis prompt
5. AI response is formatted into professional markdown report
6. Report is saved to specified file with success confirmation

### Error Handling:
- Graceful handling of missing contracts
- API authentication failures
- Network connectivity issues
- File system permissions
- Invalid project structures

### Security Features:
- API key input is hidden from terminal
- No credential storage or logging
- User controls model selection and associated costs

## Files Modified
- `aderyn/Cargo.toml` - Added dependencies
- `aderyn/src/main.rs` - Added CLI subcommand and handler
- `aderyn/src/gemini.rs` - New module with complete implementation

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with real projects
2. Gather user feedback on analysis quality
3. Consider integration with existing Aderyn workflow
4. Document the feature in user guides
